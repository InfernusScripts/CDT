# CDT - Cherry's Debug Tools ðŸ”¥
(Currently it is called CSpy, but I gonna rename it later)

## What is CDT?
- A fresh Roblox Remote Spy (not really, it supports more than that) with modern UI that you can (kinda) customise
### - Supports:
- `Remote Spy` - log outcoming & incoming requests; can hook outcoming arguments
- `Bindable Spy` (Event Spy) - log BindableEvents & BindableFunctions; can kinda hook arguments
- `HTTP Spy` - log every (I hope) HTTP request that executor doing

- More stuff coming soon
